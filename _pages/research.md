# A VLT/MUSE Survey for Accreting Planets in 67 Protoplanetary Disks 
(Li, Z. et al. 2026; in prep.)

We conduct a systematic survey of all protoplanetary disks observed with VLT/MUSE to search for accreting planets and to quantify both the detection limits of VLT/MUSE and how common systems like PDS 70 b and c are.

# A VLT/MUSE Survey for jets in 75 planetary Disks 
(Li, Z. et al. 2026; in prep.)

We find 26 jets in 75 protoplanetary disks observed with VLT/MUSE. With this large gallery, we investigate their geometry, heating, and launching mechanisms using their morphology across multiple emission lines.
